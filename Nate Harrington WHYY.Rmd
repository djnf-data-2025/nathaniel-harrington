A demo notebook for Dow Jones News Fund data interns

During the week’s training, you will work on a project called Investigate Your Community to produce detailed story pitches relevant to their summer internship positions. The goal is to have the students research a topic relevant to your newsroom so they can get to work immediately at the internship. 

Here are some examples from last year’s DJNF data journalism training:

Hannah Rosenberger, at ASI Media/Counselor magazine, produced this analysis on name, image and likeness trends: https://hrosenberger.github.io/ASI-NIL-Project/

Shifra Dayak, an intern at the Connecticut Mirror, produced this analysis of environment spill data: https://shifradayak.github.io/DJNF_Merrill/ct_env_spills.html.

Michael Zhang, an intern at the Houston Landing, explored local election data: https://michaelzhangreporter.github.io/Houston_Campaign_Finance/


Here's what your newsroom suggested for a project
Here are some newsroom-wide projects coming up that we welcome data journalism contributions from our future DJ interns.
 
Aging in the region – tentative project title is “Growing Golden: Aging with Purpose.” Numerous stories about aging and thriving in retirement will cover a range of financial, health, housing, dying, family coping and planning for retirement story topics. This is an explanatory journalism project.
 
Developing project on Black Women in the region – inspired by the election of Philadelphia’s first woman mayor and Black woman mayor. Areas of storytelling will include: politics, education and health
 
Philadelphia neighborhood guides is a project coming from Billy Penn.
 
An existing project on education is such, and we will continue to produce stories through mid-summer -- Creativity Sparks Success Project https://whyy.org/series/creativity-sparks-success/



This notebook helps you get started on the Growing Golden project.

Check Census Reporter for ideas. Here's a start
https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B01001&primary_geo_id=16000US4260000&geo_ids=16000US4260000,05000US42101,31000US37980,04000US42,01000US


```{r}

# 
# YOUR_DATA <- read.csv("../data/XXXXX.csv") |> 
#     clean_names()

# data <- read_excel("../data/2024-12-Revenue.xlsx", skip=2) |> 
#     clean_names()

data <- read.csv("data/acs2023_1yr_B01001_04000US42.csv") |> 
    clean_names() 
```

Restructure the table for 

```{r}


demographic_table <- data %>%
  # First select just the relevant columns
  select(name, matches("^b01001\\d+$")) %>%  
  # Pivot to make each b01001 variable a row
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("b01001"),
               names_to = "variable",
               values_to = "value") %>%
  # Then pivot to make each location a column
  pivot_wider(names_from = name,
              values_from = value) %>%
  # Clean up column names if needed
  rename_with(~ gsub(", PA$", "", .x), matches("Philadelphia County")) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub(" Metro Area$", "", .x), matches("Philadelphia-Camden")) |> 
  clean_names()

```


Read json file as a dataframe
```{r}

data_labels <- fromJSON("data/metadata.json")

column_list <- data_labels[["tables"]][["B01001"]][["columns"]]

# Create a dataframe from the list
label_df <- data.frame(
  variable = names(column_list),
  indent = sapply(column_list, function(x) x$indent),
  name = sapply(column_list, function(x) x$name),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
) |> 
  mutate(variable = tolower(variable))


```


# Join labels and data
```{r}
demographic_table1 <- demographic_table |> 
  inner_join(label_df, by=c("variable")) |> 
  select(name, philadelphia_pa,philadelphia_county, pennsylvania,  
          philadelphia_camden_wilmington_pa_nj_de_md,  united_states, variable, indent)

#fix to specify male-female
demographic_table1 <- demographic_table1 %>%
  mutate(name = case_when(
    # Skip rows 1, 2, 26, and 50+ (if any)
    row_number() %in% c(1, 2, 26) ~ name,
    # Add " (male)" to rows 3-25
    row_number() >= 3 & row_number() <= 25 ~ paste0(name, "_male"),
    # Add " (female)" to rows 27-49
    row_number() >= 27 & row_number() <= 49 ~ paste0(name, "_female"),
    # Keep any other rows unchanged
    TRUE ~ name
  ))

Next steps:
You should learn to use the TidyCensus package in R. It would make this work so much easier.
